# Project Title: Drone Detection Classification

**Author:** Ajay Tewari

## Executive summary

This project developed a comprehensive drone detection system using computer vision techniques to identify and classify aerial objects (drones, airplanes, helicopters, birds) for security, surveillance, and wildlife protection applications.

## Rationale - Why should anyone care about this question?
In recent years, we have observed the unprecedented usage of drone and related technologies in various areas like surveillance, security, crops monitoring, delivery drones, airspace monitoring, search & rescue operations. This incredibly useful technology has many benefits but if armed, drones pose great threat to civilian and armed forces life & infrastructure. These drones could also be used for surveillance by bad people or could be a great concern for violation of privacy. 

The anti-drone technologies used to counter these drones could also harm wild life if drone detection accuracy is not very high. Thus, drone detection model with high accuracy could save lives, critical infrastructure and avoid harm to wild life.

## Research Question - What are you trying to answer?
